- 👋 Hi, I’m Piem @piemno996
- 👀 I’m interested in:
  - Japanese Culture: Anime, Manga, Galgame, Cosplay, Kigurumi (着ぐるみ, a type of cosplay), Light Novel, Comic, ...
  - Photography (now only landscape), using Sony ILCE-7M3 (outdated camera😢)
  - Chinese Culture: Hanfu, Old architecture, Chinese Fiction, ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming. That's why I create this GitHub account.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on build a website about Galgame sharing (no copyright). Before that, much tech I should learn like Golang/js/Vue.
